Trappels-3

Algorithm Trappels:
We should use 48 long all and 4 long to check others bits then find three same varitions but not 5 and predict them. then 47 or 47-1
We should use 48 long all and 4 long to check others bits then find two same varitions but not 5 and predict them then 47 47-1 bits 
We should use 48 long all and 4 long to check others bits then find two same varitions or more and predict them then 47 47-1 after
We should use 48 long all and 4 long to check others bits then find 5 same varitions or more and predict them then 46 46-1 after 
3*8=24 and 8 or 1 times 25 or more compress bits.
+0 or 6 bits and count long. Add 1 bit add.
