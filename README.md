Trappels-3

Algorithm Trappels:

We should use 48 long all and 4 long to check others bits then find three same varitions but not 5 and predict them.
We should use 48 long all and 4 long to check others bits then find two same varitions but not 5 and predict them.
We should use 48 long all and 4 long to check others bits then find two same varitions or more and predict them.
We should use 48 long all and 4 long to check others bits then find three same varitions or more and predict them.
