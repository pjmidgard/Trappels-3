Trappels-3

Algorithm Trappels:
We should use 48 long all and 4 long to check others bits then find three same varitions but not 5 and predict them. then 47 or 47-1 bits after variations 00
We should use 48 long all and 4 long to check others bits then find two same varitions but not 5 and predict them then 47 47-1 bits after variations 01
We should use 48 long all and 4 long to check others bits then find two same varitions or more and predict them then 47 47-1 after variations 10
We should use 48 long all and 4 long to check others bits then find 5 same varitions or more and predict them then 46 46-1 after variations 11
+0 or 6 bits and count long.
