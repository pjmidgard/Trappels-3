Trappels-3

Algorithm Trappels:
We should use 48 long all and 4 long to check others bits then find three same varitions but not 5 and predict them.
We should use 48 long all and 4 long to check others bits then find two same varitions but not 5 and predict them.
We should use 48 long all and 4 long to check others bits then find two same varitions or more and predict them.
We should use 48 long all and 4 long to check others bits then find 5 same varitions or more and predict them.
3*8=24 and 24 or 1 times 25 or more compress bits.
+0 or 6 bits and count long. Add 1 bit add. We check on weight of information.
